# Matisse

This early prototype was made to demonstrate our concept for the [Co.Labs & Target Retail Accelerator](http://www.fastcolabs.com/accelerator/retail). It's built on Node.js, MongoDB and Redis, with the familiar set of tools and libraries; Express, Jade, Stylus, and Mongoose.

As of June 3, 2013 a live demo can be found at http://matisseapp.com

## To run locally:

- install node.js
- copy the `config_sample.json` file to `config.json` and add appropriate values (or make sure you have Redis + MongoDB installed locally)
- `npm install` to get the necessary packages
